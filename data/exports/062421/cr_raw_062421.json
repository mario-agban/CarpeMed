My motto is to resolve problems in a practical, secure and cost effective manner.|To my middle age 15 years of practicing, 13 years of being a gynecologist and 8 years of medical and surgical oncology, I had the opportunity to witness life and death, the joy and victory triumphs over terrible diseases, the healing of body and mind, disillusionment and defeat of failed treatment. I have sometimes thought that I have seen everything but the truth is that in this profession, even more in this life every day you learn something new, each and every patient and their families have a different world behind them. There is none like the other. I leave his short review about me with that thought and also with the idea that whatever direction the course of a life is to see it in the most positive way, give the best possible relief, offer the best that can be grant. Thanks to you, my patients, I am a better person because they taught me to see life with humility. Thanks to those who are no longer here because they change every perspective of life making every day a profit. Thanks to new lives because they are the dawn of the morning and the light of each day.|FIRST STATEMENT|About 37 years ago I was born in San Jos\u00e9, a family with a lot of love where my father, a doctor by profession and my mother, microbiologist gave me the example of many years of hard work, perseverance and academic excellence.|During my career, when I studied the subject of Gynecology and Obstetrics, I fell in love with this specialty of contrasts, where there is clinic, technology, surgery, consultation, hospitalization and so much more life, lots of life and this made me choose this path.|My professional work is one of paradox where I see both, life and death. Gynecology Oncology is a very rewarding area where people's lives can be saved, and in those where this is not possible, these women can be offered quality of life, palliative care and support for their families. On the other hand, Obstetrics is that branch of gynecology that gives life, which gives light and being able to assist in the birth of a human being is one of the most noble and emotional acts; So I feel blessed by God to be able to carry out this work.","spokenLanguages":"English, Espa\u00f1ol","website":"https:\/\/directorio.hospitalcima.com\/en\/doctor\/adriana-sanchez-ramirez","email":"mailto:dr.adrianasanchezramirez@gmail.com","hoursOperation":null,"hoursOperationObj":null,"confirmedHours":false,"ratings":null,"rating":null,"education":"Specialty in Oncology. |Universidad de Costa Rica - Facultad de Medicina. | January 2013|Specialty in Gynecology and Obstetrics. |Universidad de Costa Rica - Facultad de Medicina. | January 2003|Doctor and Surgery. |Universidad de Costa Rica - Facultad de Medicina. | January 2001","additionalInformation":"Consultation|Bartholin gland abscess drainage|Bartholin's gland extirpation|Breast biopsy|Breast exam|Breast node surgery|Cervical cerclage|Cervical, vaginal or vulvar polyp removal|Cervix biopsy|Cesarean postpartum hysterectomy|Colposcopy|Cryosurgery|Gynecologic control|Gynecological ultrasound|Human papillomavirus (HPV) exam|Hysterectomy|Hysteroscope|Intrauterine Device Placement (Device not included)|Labor control and care|Mammography|Natural birth attention|Obstetric Ultrasound|Pelvic endometriosis laparoscopy|Pelvic exam|Placement copper T (Device not included)|Prenatal care|Quadrantectomy|Single C-section (one baby)|Tranvaginal echography|Uterine neck cerclage removal|Uterine prolapse surgery|Vaginal exam|Vaginal foreign growth removal|Vaginal Hysterectomy|Vaginal, juxta, or paracervical cyst removal|Vulva benign tumor removal|Vulva biopsy|Breast cancer|Endometriosis|Ovarian mass growth|Polycystic ovary|Uncontrolled menstruation|Abnormal fetal position|Abnormal Pap|Birth|Birth control pills|Bladder problems|Breast pain|Burning during sex|Cervical dysplasia|Cervicitis|Climacteric|Ectopic pregnancy (eccysis)|Endometrial hyperplasia|Fallen bladder (cystocele)|Fibroma (benign connective tissue tumor)|Gestational diabetes|Hormonal disorder|Hot flash|Hydrosalpinx|Intrauterine growth restriction|Mammary duct ectasia|Mastitis|Menarche|Menopause|Menopause flashes|Menstruation|Menstruation pain|Missed menstrual period|Myoma (benign muscle tumor)|Ovarian abscess|Ovarian cyst|Pain during sex|Pelvic pain|Placenta previa|Pregnancy complications\/problems|Pregnant woman seizures (eclampsia)|Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)|Prolapse of uterus|Rectal prolapse|Recurrent miscarriage|Thelarche|Tuboovarian abscess|Urinary tract infection (UTI)|Uterine bleeding|Uterine prolapse|Vaginal bleeding|Vaginal burning|Vaginal discharge|Vaginal itching|Vaginal thrush|Vaginitis|Vomiting during pregnancy|Vulvitis|Yeast infection|Oncological Gynecology at Universidad de Costa Rica|Certificate of Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG), USA|Internal Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital - West Roxbury, Massachusetts USA|Internal Medicine at the Primary Care Clinic of Tulane Medical Center, Charity Hospital.

The focus in my practice is oriented towards a better quality of life in the above aspects, without omitting its genito-urinary control.|Dr. Andrea Guevara has been a physician for 21 years and has practiced urology for 19 years. He specialized in Urology 15 years ago at the University of Costa Rica. Later, she was admitted in Paris, France at the Pierre et Marie Curie University through the Henri Mondor Hospital, completing an In-Depth Postgraduate Degree in Urology with an Emphasis in Oncological Urology and Advanced Surgical Techniques including Robotic Surgery in 2009 and also a Diploma in Urodynamics Female and Functional Urology. He has published in the American Journal of Urology on Bladder Cancer. She worked for 10 years at the San Juan de Dios Hospital, and was the first female urologist to be admitted as an assistant physician in a class A Adult Hospital in Costa Rica and is the third urologist to graduate in Costa Rica. Currently, he only practices private medicine at the CIMA San Jos\u00e9 Hospital and at the Momentum Pinares Medical Tower. His emphasis is on prostate and bladder diseases, andrology, female and functional urology, as well as the comprehensive management of the male patient, accompanying him as his doctor in his different stages of life (erectile dysfunction, infertility, prostate control, testicular, male health general). In addition, he frequently attends courses and congresses on medical updating and participates as an international and national lecturer.

During my internship at the Santa Cruz Hospital, I received a patient with an abortion who I had to refer out given that I wasn\u2019t a gynecologist at the time. It was then when I decided to specialize in Gynecology and Obstetrics because it is a very versatile field which allows me to truly help women. It also gives me the opportunity of creating strong, long-lasting relationships with my patients while being able to be a part of their happiest moments in life, like pregnancy. What I enjoy the most about my work is being able to help with complicated cases that other Gynecologists won\u2019t attend.
