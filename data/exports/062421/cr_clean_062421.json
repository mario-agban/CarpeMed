Then, I returned to the country to specialize in neurosurgery at the University of Costa Rica, where I achieved graduation with honors thanks to the excellent doctors who accompanied me in my learning process., Since then, I have not stopped updating my knowledge, starting with Pediatric Neurosurgery and Image-guided Surgery at Brigham Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston, where I was an international fellow of the American Neurosurgery Association. Later, I obtained my license to practice medicine in the United States of America and completed my training as a pediatric neurosurgeon with an emphasis in neuro-oncology at Northwestern University Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, with the goal of returning to Costa Rica. and offer this knowledge to the children of my country., In addition to working for the Costa Rican Social Security Fund at the National Children's Hospital and at the Cima San Jos\u00e9 Hospital, I have been a postgraduate professor at the University of Costa Rica for many years, training many other generations of neurosurgeons and neurosurgeons. With the need to share and disseminate the advances in modern techniques in my specialty, I am part of several international neurosurgery organizations such as the International Society of Pediatric Neurosurgery (ISPN), holding executive positions as secretary and treasurer. For 5 years I have participated as a teacher in Neuroendoscopy at the Federico II University in Naples, Italy in conjunction with the International Federation of Neuroendoscopy (IFNE). Finally, I hold the position of Secretary both in the Latin American group of Neuroendoscopy Studies (GLEN) as well as in the Latin American Association of Pediatric Neurosurgery (ASOLAMPED), which is at the same time part of the Latin American Federation of Neurosurgery Societies (FLANC) .

My motto is to resolve problems in a practical, secure and cost effective manner., To my middle age 15 years of practicing, 13 years of being a gynecologist and 8 years of medical and surgical oncology, I had the opportunity to witness life and death, the joy and victory triumphs over terrible diseases, the healing of body and mind, disillusionment and defeat of failed treatment. I have sometimes thought that I have seen everything but the truth is that in this profession, even more in this life every day you learn something new, each and every patient and their families have a different world behind them. There is none like the other. I leave his short review about me with that thought and also with the idea that whatever direction the course of a life is to see it in the most positive way, give the best possible relief, offer the best that can be grant. Thanks to you, my patients, I am a better person because they taught me to see life with humility. Thanks to those who are no longer here because they change every perspective of life making every day a profit. Thanks to new lives because they are the dawn of the morning and the light of each day., FIRST STATEMENT, About 37 years ago I was born in San Jos\u00e9, a family with a lot of love where my father, a doctor by profession and my mother, microbiologist gave me the example of many years of hard work, perseverance and academic excellence., During my career, when I studied the subject of Gynecology and Obstetrics, I fell in love with this specialty of contrasts, where there is clinic, technology, surgery, consultation, hospitalization and so much more life, lots of life and this made me choose this path., My professional work is one of paradox where I see both, life and death. Gynecology Oncology is a very rewarding area where people's lives can be saved, and in those where this is not possible, these women can be offered quality of life, palliative care and support for their families. On the other hand, Obstetrics is that branch of gynecology that gives life, which gives light and being able to assist in the birth of a human being is one of the most noble and emotional acts; So I feel blessed by God to be able to carry out this work.","spokenLanguages":"English, Espa\u00f1ol","website":"https:\/\/directorio.hospitalcima.com\/en\/doctor\/adriana-sanchez-ramirez","email":"dr.adrianasanchezramirez@gmail.com","hoursOperation":null,"confirmedHours":false,"ratings":null,"rating":null,"education":[{"date":"2013, 2003, 2001","title":"Specialty in Oncology. ,Universidad de Costa Rica - Facultad de Medicina. , January 2013,Specialty in Gynecology and Obstetrics. ,Universidad de Costa Rica - Facultad de Medicina. , January 2003,Doctor and Surgery. ,Universidad de Costa Rica - Facultad de Medicina. , January 2001","issuer":""}],"additionalInformation":"Consultation,Bartholin gland abscess drainage,Bartholin's gland extirpation,Breast biopsy,Breast exam,Breast node surgery,Cervical cerclage,Cervical, vaginal or vulvar polyp removal,Cervix biopsy,Cesarean postpartum hysterectomy,Colposcopy,Cryosurgery,Gynecologic control,Gynecological ultrasound,Human papillomavirus (HPV) exam,Hysterectomy,Hysteroscope,Intrauterine Device Placement (Device not included),Labor control and care,Mammography,Natural birth attention,Obstetric Ultrasound,Pelvic endometriosis laparoscopy,Pelvic exam,Placement copper T (Device not included),Prenatal care,Quadrantectomy,Single C-section (one baby),Tranvaginal echography,Uterine neck cerclage removal,Uterine prolapse surgery,Vaginal exam,Vaginal foreign growth removal,Vaginal Hysterectomy,Vaginal, juxta, or paracervical cyst removal,Vulva benign tumor removal,Vulva biopsy,Breast cancer,Endometriosis,Ovarian mass growth,Polycystic ovary,Uncontrolled menstruation,Abnormal fetal position,Abnormal Pap,Birth,Birth control pills,Bladder problems,Breast pain,Burning during sex,Cervical dysplasia,Cervicitis,Climacteric,Ectopic pregnancy (eccysis),Endometrial hyperplasia,Fallen bladder (cystocele),Fibroma (benign connective tissue tumor),Gestational diabetes,Hormonal disorder,Hot flash,Hydrosalpinx,Intrauterine growth restriction,Mammary duct ectasia,Mastitis,Menarche,Menopause,Menopause flashes,Menstruation,Menstruation pain,Missed menstrual period,Myoma (benign muscle tumor),Ovarian abscess,Ovarian cyst,Pain during sex,Pelvic pain,Placenta previa,Pregnancy complications\/problems,Pregnant woman seizures (eclampsia),Premenstrual syndrome (PMS),Prolapse of uterus,Rectal prolapse,Recurrent miscarriage,Thelarche,Tuboovarian abscess,Urinary tract infection (UTI),Uterine bleeding,Uterine prolapse,Vaginal bleeding,Vaginal burning,Vaginal discharge,Vaginal itching,Vaginal thrush,Vaginitis,Vomiting during pregnancy,Vulvitis,Yeast infection,Oncological Gynecology at Universidad de Costa Rica,Certificate of Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG), USA,Internal Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital - West Roxbury, Massachusetts USA,Internal Medicine at the Primary Care Clinic of Tulane Medical Center, Charity Hospital.

Later, she was admitted in Paris, France at the Pierre et Marie Curie University through the Henri Mondor Hospital, completing an In-Depth Postgraduate Degree in Urology with an Emphasis in Oncological Urology and Advanced Surgical Techniques including Robotic Surgery in 2009 and also a Diploma in Urodynamics Female and Functional Urology. He has published in the American Journal of Urology on Bladder Cancer. She worked for 10 years at the San Juan de Dios Hospital, and was the first female urologist to be admitted as an assistant physician in a class A Adult Hospital in Costa Rica and is the third urologist to graduate in Costa Rica. Currently, he only practices private medicine at the CIMA San Jos\u00e9 Hospital and at the Momentum Pinares Medical Tower. His emphasis is on prostate and bladder diseases, andrology, female and functional urology, as well as the comprehensive management of the male patient, accompanying him as his doctor in his different stages of life (erectile dysfunction, infertility, prostate control, testicular, male health general). In addition, he frequently attends courses and congresses on medical updating and participates as an international and national lecturer. But the most important thing is that she distributes her time among her patients, her family, her studies, sports and a very healthy life, representing the modern, professional and pioneer woman in opening a field that was forbidden for many decades to female doctors.","spokenLanguages":"English, fran\u00e7ais, Espa\u00f1ol","website":"https:\/\/directorio.hospitalcima.com\/en\/doctor\/andrea-guevara-moya","email":"dra.andreaguevara@gmail.com","hoursOperation":null,"confirmedHours":false,"ratings":null,"rating":null,"education":[{"date":"2006, 2000","title":"Specialty in Urology. ,Universidad de Costa Rica - Facultad de Medicina. , 2006,Doctor and Surgery. ,Universidad de Costa Rica - Facultad de Medicina. , 2000","issuer":""}],"additionalInformation":"Consultation,Laser kidney stone treatment,bladder biopsy,Prostate surgery,Urodynamic tests,Artificial sphincter placement (men),mesh placement,Circumcision,Coraliform calculus surgical treatment,Cystoscope,Cystostomy,Distal hypospadias surgery,Double J stent placement,Ectopic abdominal testicle surgery,Endoscopic cystography,Cervicotomy,Epididymal cysts resection surgery,Hydrocele with hernia surgery,Kidney cyst surgery,Kidney surgery,Laparoscopic nephrectomy,Male cytology,Nocturia evaluation,Online Medicine,Orquidectomy,Papilloma electrocoagulation (EC),Penis Frenulectomy,Penis prosthesis placement,Percutaneous nephrolithotomy,Pericervical injection for female urinary incontinence,Prostate laser surgery,Unilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy,Renal transplant,Reverse vasectomy,Simple cystectomy,Spermatic cord torsion surgery,Total prostatectomy,Total urethrectomy,Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP),Umbilical hernia surgery,Ureteral calcium stone endoscopic removal,Ureteral calculus surgical treatment,Ureteral catheter removal,Ureteral stenosis surgery,Ureteroscopy,Urethral dilatation,Varicocele surgery,Varicocelectomy,Vasectomy,Vesical calcium ston endoscopic removal,Vesicoureteral reflux endoscopy,Vesicular irrigation,Bladder problems,Cystitis,Enlarged prostate,Kidney stone,Prostate cancer,Adrenal tumor,Balanitis (foreskin inflammation),Bladder cancer,Broken pelvis,Burning during urinating,Chancroid,Cryptorchidism,Curved penis,Delayed ejaculation,Epidimitis,Excessive urination at night,Fournier gangrene,Genital warts,Hematospermia (blood in semen),Hematuria (blood in the urine),Kidney cancer,Leukoplakia,Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV),Male infertility,Male sexual disorder,Penis cancer,Penis diversion,Penis infection,Perinuem cancer,Phimosis,Premature ejaculation,Prostate pain,Renal colic (kidney nephritic syndrome),Sexual development disorder,Sexual dysfunction,Sexual function problems,Sexual impotence (erectile dysfunction),Spermatocele (spermatic cyst),Testicle absence,Testicular cancer,Testicular torsion,Twisted spermatic cord,Ureteral obstruction,Urethral Cancer,Urethral meatal stenosis,Urinary tract infection (UTI),Laparoscopic Surgery - Henri Mondor Hospital.

We understand and meet our patients\u2019 needs thanks to our group of specialists in several areas of dentistry; we leverage this diversity to provide the best available treatment., I became an Orthodontist because ever since I was a child I have wanted to help others plus I have always had great hand dexterity. When I was a young boy, I had a noticeable facial deformity (large maxilla and protruding teeth) and an excellent orthodontist corrected my problem, helping improve my self-esteem. Since then, I\u2019ve had the predisposition to study orthodontics so that I could help other people. The best part of my job is when we complete a dental treatment and our patients show us their gratitude with a very large smile. This is a very rewarding experience., I also enjoy teaching to share some of the knowledge that I\u2019ve gained and to help instill values in my students.

Being able to see how the life of a person changes when their weight is reduced, is something extremely rewarding. , On the other hand, I believe that laparoscopic surgery is also something that makes me proud, because since it is minimally invasive, it allows shorter recovery time and fewer operative scars.","spokenLanguages":"English, fran\u00e7ais, Espa\u00f1ol","website":"https:\/\/directorio.hospitallacatolica.com\/en\/doctor\/cynthia-marcela-solano-estrada","email":"drasolano@me.com","hoursOperation":null,"confirmedHours":false,"ratings":null,"rating":null,"education":[{"date":"2007, 2001","title":"Specialty in General Surgery. ,Universidad de Costa Rica - Facultad de Medicina. , December 2007,Doctor and Surgery. ,Universidad de Costa Rica - Facultad de Medicina. , December 2001","issuer":""}],"additionalInformation":"Consultation,Colon diverticulitis surgery,Cutaneous biopsy,Gastric bypass surgery,Laparoscopic appendectomy,Laparoscopic appendectomy,Lymph node biopsy,Meckel's diverticulum surgery,Open appendix surgery,Appendicitis,Cholecystitis,Gallstones,Hiatal Hernia,Morbid obesity,Abdominal pain,Adrenal tumor,Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),Inguinal hernia,Intestinal perforation,Lipoma (benign fatty tumor),Umbilical hernia,Fellowship in Laparoscopic Surgery - IRCAD Institute, Universit\u00e9 Louis-Pasteur.
